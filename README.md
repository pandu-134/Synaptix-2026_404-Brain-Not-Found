## 🛑 Problem Statement

**Develop an Adaptive Online Assessment Platform that dynamically adjusts question difficulty in real time based on student responses and performance patterns. The system should generate a personalized competency profile at the end of the assessment, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and mastery levels across topics.**

---

## ⚙️ Core System Mechanics

To solve the problem statement, Synaptix utilizes three core pillars:

1. **Dynamic Difficulty Routing:** The engine evaluates user input instantly. Correct answers trigger advanced-level questions to test upper limits, while incorrect answers gracefully scale down complexity to pinpoint exact knowledge gaps.
2. **Real-Time Performance Tracking:** Algorithms continuously monitor patterns across multiple sub-topics, moving beyond simple pass/fail metrics to understand genuine cognitive mastery.
3. **Competency Profiling:** Generates a comprehensive, data-rich diagnostic report highlighting specific strengths and actionable areas for improvement.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Proposed)

* **Frontend:** React.js (Vite)
* **Styling:** CSS3 / Tailwind CSS (Futuristic UI/UX)
* **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
* **Backend Integration (Planned):** RESTful API / Python (FastAPI/Flask) for the adaptive algorithm logic
